SSH:

Uses SSH keys (public/private key pair) for authentication.

Once the key is set up, no need to enter your username/password every time.

Requires a one-time setup of SSH keys and adding the public key to your Git hosting provider (e.g., GitHub/GitLab).

HTTPS:

Uses username and password/token for each operation.

May prompt for credentials frequently, unless cached or using a credential manager.
